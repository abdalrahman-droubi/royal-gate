Our team provides a detailed breakdown of all costs involved."

    "faq3": {
      "question": "How long does the property buying process take?",

    "faq5": {
      "question": "Do I need to pay property tax in Dubai?",
      "answer": "No, there is no property tax, capital gains tax, or income tax on rental income in Dubai. Property owners only pay an annual service charge for maintenance of common areas, and a 5% municipality tax on rental income (paid by tenants through DEWA bills)."
    },
